`In the vast cosmos of code, two sisters dance across the universe of your editor: Void Iris and **Endless Iris. Born from the same stellar nebula, they are two sides of the same cosmic coin—one embracing the infinite darkness, the other bathing in eternal light.`

## 🌌 The Tale of Two Sisters

**Void Iris** is the elder sister—mysterious, enigmatic, and bold. She dwells in the deepest voids of space, where neon rain falls in ultraviolet hues and the darkness itself becomes a canvas for your thoughts. Her palette whispers of cyberpunk nights, stormy purple skies, and the surreal glow of distant galaxies. When you need to dive deep into the abyss of code, she is your guide through the void.

**Endless Iris** is the younger sister—radiant, luminous, and boundless. She lives in the endless expanse of light, where the same cosmic energy that birthed her sibling now flows through pristine whites and soft pastels. Her palette echoes the same violet mysteries but bathed in daylight, offering clarity and brightness for those who seek the light. When you need to see clearly through the cosmos of your code, she illuminates your path.

Together, they are the **Galaxy Sisters**—two themes, one soul, endless possibilities. Choose the darkness of the void or the light of the endless sky. Both await your journey.

> _“Two sisters, one cosmos—boundless in the void, endless in the light.”_
